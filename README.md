# Hotel Booking Database Project

This project simulates a **relational database** for a hotel booking system and demonstrates core **SQL skills** and **database management concepts** in action.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **mini hotel management system** using SQL. It covers:

- Table creation with proper relationships  
- Sample data insertion for realistic scenarios  
- Analytical queries for business insights  

The database includes four main entities:

- `Guests` – personal information about hotel guests  
- `Rooms` – details on room types and pricing  
- `Bookings` – reservation records with check-in and check-out dates  
- `Payments` – payment transactions for each booking  

## Technologies Used

- SQL (MySQL syntax)  
- Local SQL environment

## Database Schema

| Table     | Description                                |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| Guests    | Guest names, date of birth, contact details |
| Rooms     | Room number, type, price per night          |
| Bookings  | Check-in/check-out dates, guest-room link   |
| Payments  | Payment method, amount, payment status      |

Tables are connected via **primary and foreign keys**.

## Sample Insights & Query Highlights

This project includes SQL queries that answer real business questions:

- Number of bookings per guest  
- Guest age calculation from date of birth  
- Average price per night by room type  
- Stay duration and booking day trends  
- Ranking of guests by total payments  

Techniques used:

- SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY  
- Aggregation (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.)  
- CASE WHEN statements  
- NULL handling  
- Window functions (e.g., RANK, ROW_NUMBER)

## File Contents

- `hotel_schema.sql` – database schema (CREATE TABLE)  
- `sample_data.sql` – sample data for all tables  
- `analysis_queries.sql` – queries for insights and reporting  
- `README.md` – this documentation

## Use Case

This project is ideal for showcasing:

- Relational database design  
- SQL query building  
- Analytical thinking in a hotel management context
